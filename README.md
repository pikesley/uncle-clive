#Introduction

You may see a more pointless Thing-as-a-Service today, but I hope not. Uncle Clive is a massively over-engineered solution to a problem that I'm almost 100% certain does not exist - rendering the 1982 Sinclair Spectrum character set in various interesting ways.

It's mostly an exercise in me learning how to do REST and conneg (and possibly semver).

It's running at [http://uncleclive.herokuapp.com/](http://uncleclive.herokuapp.com/)

##Content negotiation

Uncle-Clive will respond to the following _Accept_ values with appropriate content:

###application/json

Content will be returned as a JSON object thus:
